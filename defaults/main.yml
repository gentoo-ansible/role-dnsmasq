# 1. Allows DHCP hosts to have fully qualified domain names, as long

# 2. Sets the "domain" DHCP option thereby potentially setting the
#    domain of all systems configured by DHCP.
# 3. Provides the domain part for "expand-hosts" (see {{dnsmasq_dns_expand_hosts}}).

# You may also set a different domain for a particular subnet, for example:
# thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.2.0/24.

# Expectes array of hashes with keys:

#   to         - The last IPv4/IPv6 address in the pool.
#   mode       - One of static, or proxy (IPv4 only), or ra-only, slaac,
#                ra-names, ra-stateless, ra-advrouter, and off-link (IPv6 only).
#                Open man dnsmasq and find "--dhcp-range" for more

#   netmask    - IPv4 only; for directly connected networks is optional.
#   prefix     - IPv6 only; default is 64.
#   lease_time - The lease time in seconds (e.g. 30), minutes (e.g. 45m),
#                hours (e.g. 1h), or "infinite". Should not be used for IPv6.

# Specify per host parameters for the DHCP server. This allows a machine with

# Expects path to the file on a control machine that should be copied to the
# remote machine, OR an array of hashes with keys:
#   mac        - MAC (hardware) address (required if hostname is not given).
#   hostname   - If "mac" is specified, then it's optional and it overrides
#                any hostname supplied by the DHCP client. Otherwise it is
#                required and it identifies the DHCP client instead of MAC.

# barge in and take over the lease for any client which broadcasts on the
# network, whether it has a record of the lease or not. This avoids long

# accidentally configuring a DHCP server for your campus/company accidentally!

# Whether to do router advertisements for all subnets where we're doing DHCPv6.
# Unless overriden by ra-stateless, ra-names, et al, the router advertisements

# configuration from DHCPv6, and the A bit reset, so the clients don't use
# SLAAC addresses.
